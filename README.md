# Pollution, People & Product: Journey to Design the Perfect Air Purifier for India

---

## Overview

“AirPure Innovations” is a response to India’s severe air pollution crisis, with 14 of its cities among the world’s top 20 most polluted.

The startup faces a crucial challenge: Is there lasting demand for their air purifier?

Before investing in full-scale development, AirPure needs to know:

- Which pollutants plague Indian cities most? 
- What features do customers truly need? 
- Where is demand strongest, and how big are those markets? 
- And finally, how can R&D be tailored for each city’s unique pollution profile?
