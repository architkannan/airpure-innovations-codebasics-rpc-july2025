# Pollution, People & Product: Journey to Design the Perfect Air Purifier for India

***A Power BI project to guide product development, prioritize high-risk cities, and optimize air purifier features based on air quality, health, and consumer demand insights.***

This project was my submission for the [**Codebasics Resume Project Challenge**](https://codebasics.io/challenges/codebasics-resume-project-challenge/20) for July 2025.

### ‚ùóThe Problem
- India faces severe air pollution, with 14 cities ranking among the world‚Äôs top 20 most polluted urban centers.
- ***AirPure Innovations***, an early-stage air purifier startup, needed answers on:
  - Pollutants to target
  - Essential product features
  - Priority cities and market size
  - How R&D should align with local pollution patterns
- Decision-making was hindered by fragmented AQI, health, population, and vehicle datasets.

## üìù Overview
This project analyzes three core dimensions to guide product-market fit:
1.	**Severity Mapping**‚Äì Cities with persistent or worsening AQI levels.
2.	**Health Impact Correlation** ‚Äì The health burden of pollution and its effect on consumer well-being.
3.	**Demand Triggers** ‚Äì How pollution spikes influence consumer behavior and purifier demand.


**Goal:** Design a ***self-explanatory dashboard*** for management and the product strategy team.


**Deliverables:**

‚Ä¢	**Market Prioritization Dashboard** with:

    o	City risk scores (AQI √ó population density √ó income)
    
    o	Health cost impact projections
  
‚Ä¢	**Product Requirements Document** outlining:

    o	Must-have features
    
    o	Competitor feature gap matrix
    
    o	Tiered pricing models for target segments

## üî¢ Data Sources

The primary actual datasets for this project were sourced from [**Dataful**](https://dataful.in/).

1. **Air Quality Index (AQI)**: Day-wise, state-wise AQI for major Indian cities (2022‚Äì2025).  
2. **Health Data**: Disease cases & deaths by state/district (2022‚Äì2025).  
3. **Vehicle Registration Data**: State-wise vehicle counts by class/fuel type (2022‚Äì2025).  
4. **Population Projections**: State & gender-wise urban population (2011‚Äì2036).  
5. **External Research & Trends**: Google Trends search interest (air purifier purchase, child asthma-related terms), competitor analysis, and secondary research basis research papers.

## ‚úÖ Solution: Dashboard & Analytics
I developed a **Power BI dashboard** to provide actionable insights for AirPure Innovations:

**Tools & Techniques**
- **Power BI**
- **Excel**
- **DAX**

![AirPure Innovations Dashboard](https://github.com/architkannan/airpure-innovations-codebasics-rpc-july2025/blob/main/AirPureInnovations.gif)



**Dashboard Structure & Insights:**

| Visual | Purpose and Key Insight |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Bar chart ‚Äì Top 5 & Bottom 5 cities** | Identified most and least polluted cities. Byrnihat had 9X higher average AQI than Tirunelveli (Dec 2024 ‚Äì May 2025). |
| **Column chart ‚Äì Monthly AQI trends** | Nov‚ÄìJan consistently exceeded mean AQI in top 10 states by area (Apr 2022‚ÄìApr 2025). |
| **Pie chart ‚Äì Bengaluru vs Delhi** | Bengaluru recorded 24X more 'Satisfactory' air quality days than Delhi (Mar‚ÄìMay 2025). |
| **Weekday vs Weekend AQI column chart** | Negligible difference across metros ‚Äî pollution is consistent daily. |
| **Pollutant Concentration Matrix** | PM2.5 & PM10 identified as top pollutants nationally. |
| **Population vs AQI combo chart** | Northern cities show high AQI regardless of population size. |
| **Health Correlation Tables** | AQI spikes correlate with child asthma searches (r=0.94) and air purifier purchase keywords (also r=0.94). |
| **Competitor Perception Map** | Recommended opportunity zone based on competition positioning. |
| **City Risk & Health Cost Matrix** | Heatmap highlighted high-risk Tier 1 metros and emerging hotspots. |
